## 📋 Overview

StrabismusCare is an innovative AI-powered mobile application designed to revolutionize the screening and management of strabismus, a common eye condition affecting millions worldwide. By leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence, we provide accessible, efficient, and accurate diagnostic solutions that empower users to take control of their eye health while facilitating better communication with healthcare providers. [3]

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 AI-Based Screening
- **High Accuracy Detection**: Captures and analyzes corneal light reflection images to detect strabismus with 98% accuracy, 95.8% sensitivity, and 97.9% specificity
- **Instant Results**: Provides immediate diagnostic feedback without requiring specialized equipment

### 📱 User-Friendly Interface
- **Intuitive Design**: Simple navigation suitable for individuals of all ages
- **Guided Process**: Clear step-by-step instructions for capturing high-quality diagnostic images

### 📊 Digital Health Records
- **Secure Storage**: Safely maintains user data, including test results and medical history
- **Progress Tracking**: Allows users to monitor their condition over time

### 👨‍⚕️ Patient-Physician Interaction
- **Real-Time Communication**: Integrated chat feature for direct communication with healthcare providers
- **Treatment Monitoring**: Facilitates follow-ups and provides timely feedback on treatment plans

### 📚 Educational Resources
- **Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive information about strabismus, its effects, and management options
- **Informed Decisions**: Empowers users with knowledge to make better choices about their eye health [6]

## 🛠️ Technological Highlights

- **Advanced AI Models**: Utilizes Vision Transformer architecture for superior image analysis and anomaly detection
- **Real-Time Processing**: Delivers instant diagnostic results for timely intervention
- **Secure Cloud Integration**: HIPAA-compliant data storage with seamless access for authorized users
- **Healthcare System Compatibility**: Integrates with electronic health record (EHR) systems
